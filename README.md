# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
Hello everyone, this is my first java project and it turned out to be a game! to be exact: Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

about the project:

- Created a Tic-Tac-Toe game that provides three options: Human vs Human, Human vs AI / AI vs Human, and AI vs AI

- Developed three difficulty levels for the AI to play against: 
  -	Easy: AI makes random moves
  -	Medium: AI can look one step ahead; It tries to win, when possible, in the next move, or blocks the other player from winning in the next move.
  -	Hard: AI is impossible to lose. It either wins or draws. Implemented this level using the “Minimax” algorithm so that the AI can look one step ahead, two steps ahead
    or even look for all possible outcomes of the game at any given position.

How to play:

1 - type "start player1 player2". Each player can be "user" or a difficulty level : "easy", "medium", or "hard". The first player plays first and uses X, the second one uses O.

2 - Type in coordinates in the desired position, ranging from 1 to 3 (row, column) as demonstrated below:

(1,1)|(1,2)|(1,3)

(2,1)|(2,2)|(2,3)

(3,1)|(3,2)|(3,3)

After each game you can exit the program by typing "exit" or go to the next game by repeating step 1 and 2
